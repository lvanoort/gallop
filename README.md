## Warning: gallop is currently in early exploratory development and is not ready for use. 

Gallop is (assuming I finish it) intended to be a flexible library for allowing you to encapsulate the tedious logic for 
request/response/parse/retry/etc. that regularly comes up when interacting with APIs.

Its focus will be on flexibility and ease of use with an eye toward working well with APIs that are not, should we say,
sanely designed. This may sometimes result in performance tradeoffs or allowing you to create very odd configurations
with gallop.
